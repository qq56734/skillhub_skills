| 10+ gaps | CRITICAL | CRITICAL | CRITICAL | CRITICAL |

3.3. Assign overall contract risk score.

**STEP 4 — Redline Generation** `[20 min]`

4.1. For each MISSING element: draft the complete clause using model language from SKILL.md Section 4. Mark as `[INSERTION — Kevin]`.

4.2. For each WEAK element: draft replacement language strengthening the provision. Mark as `[REVISION — Kevin]` with tracked changes showing original vs. proposed.

4.3. For each PRESENT element: confirm adequacy. If any language conflicts with applicable law, flag as `[CONFLICT — Kevin]`.

4.4. Apply jurisdiction-specific requirements:
- If EU market: ensure full EU AI Act alignment
- If Colorado: ensure CAIA compliance
- If California: ensure CCPA/CPRA service provider provisions
- If international transfers: ensure SCC or equivalent mechanisms

**STEP 5 — Negotiation Strategy Memo** `[10 min]`

5.1. Rank all redlines by priority: MUST-HAVE, SHOULD-HAVE, NICE-TO-HAVE.

5.2. For each MUST-HAVE, provide:
- The business and legal rationale
- The consequence of not obtaining this term
- A fallback position if the vendor pushes back

5.3. Identify any deal-breakers (elements that, if rejected, should halt the deal).

| **ISO/IEC 42001:2023** | AI management system standard |

### Process

**STEP 1 — Prohibited Practice Screen** `[10 min]`

Screen the AI system against all prohibited practices under EU AI Act Art. 5. If ANY of the following are TRUE, the system is **BANNED** and cannot proceed:

| # | Prohibited Practice | Test Question | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Subliminal manipulation | Does the system deploy techniques beyond a person's consciousness to materially distort behavior in a way that causes or is likely to cause harm? | YES → `BANNED` / NO → Continue |
| 1.2 | Exploitation of vulnerabilities | Does the system exploit vulnerabilities of specific groups (age, disability, social/economic situation) to distort behavior causing harm? | YES → `BANNED` / NO → Continue |
| 1.3 | Social scoring by public authorities | Does the system evaluate or classify persons based on social behavior or personal characteristics leading to detrimental treatment? | YES → `BANNED` / NO → Continue |
| 1.4 | Predictive policing (solely profiling) | Does the system assess risk of criminal offending based solely on profiling or personality traits? | YES → `BANNED` / NO → Continue |
| 1.5 | Untargeted facial recognition scraping | Does the system create or expand facial recognition databases through untargeted scraping? | YES → `BANNED` / NO → Continue |
| 1.6 | Emotion recognition in workplace/school | Does the system infer emotions in workplace or educational settings (except for medical/safety reasons)? | YES → `BANNED` / NO → Continue |
| 1.7 | Biometric categorization (sensitive attributes) | Does the system categorize individuals based on biometric data to deduce race, political opinions, trade union membership, religious beliefs, sex life, or sexual orientation? | YES → `BANNED` / NO → Continue |
| 1.8 | Real-time remote biometric ID in public spaces | Does the system perform real-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement? | YES → `BANNED` (narrow exceptions) / NO → Continue |

If all answers are NO, proceed to Step 2.

**STEP 2 — High-Risk Classification (EU AI Act)** `[15 min]`

2.1. **Annex I check:** Is the AI system a safety component of, or itself, a product covered by EU harmonization legislation listed in Annex I (e.g., machinery, medical devices, vehicles, toys, lifts, radio equipment, civil aviation, rail systems)?
- YES → **HIGH-RISK** under Art. 6(1) → Proceed to Step 3
- NO → Continue to 2.2

2.2. **Annex III check:** Does the AI system fall into any of these categories?

| Category | Examples | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Biometrics (not prohibited above) | Remote biometric identification, emotion recognition (non-workplace), biometric categorization | HIGH-RISK |
| Critical infrastructure | AI managing energy, water, gas, heating, digital infrastructure, road traffic, supply of water | HIGH-RISK |
| Education & vocational training | AI determining access to education, evaluating learning outcomes, monitoring cheating | HIGH-RISK |
| Employment & workers management | AI for recruitment, screening, evaluating candidates, making promotion/termination/task allocation decisions | HIGH-RISK |
| Access to essential services | AI for credit scoring, risk assessment in insurance, evaluating eligibility for public benefits, emergency dispatching | HIGH-RISK |

| Administration of justice | AI assisting judicial authorities in researching/interpreting facts and law, applying law to facts | HIGH-RISK |

2.3. **Exception check:** Even if matched above, the system is NOT high-risk if it performs a narrow procedural task, improves the result of a previously completed human activity, detects decision-making patterns without replacing human assessment, or is a preparatory task for an assessment in Annex III. Apply Art. 6(3) exceptions.

2.4. Record classification result: `PROHIBITED` / `HIGH-RISK` / `LIMITED RISK` / `MINIMAL RISK`

**STEP 3 — CAIA Classification** `[10 min]`

3.1. Does the AI system make or substantially support a **consequential decision** — a decision that has a material legal or similarly significant effect on a consumer's access to or terms of:

| Domain | Consequential? |
|---|---|
| Education enrollment or opportunity | YES |
| Employment or employment opportunity | YES |
| Financial or lending service | YES |
| Government service | YES |
| Healthcare service | YES |
| Housing | YES |
| Insurance | YES |
| Legal service | YES |

3.2. If YES to any: classify as **CAIA-regulated.** Determine whether the startup is a "developer" (builds/trains the AI) or "deployer" (uses the AI) or both.

**STEP 4 — GPAI Model Assessment** `[5 min]`

4.1. Is the AI system built on or does it integrate a general-purpose AI model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Mistral)?

4.2. If the startup is the **provider** of a GPAI model:
- Technical documentation obligations (Art. 53)
- Copyright compliance (Art. 53(1)(c))
- Training data summary publication (Art. 53(1)(d))
- Systemic risk assessment if model exceeds 10^25 FLOPs (Art. 51)

4.3. If the startup is a **downstream deployer** of a GPAI model:
- Ensure the GPAI provider is compliant
- Maintain your own transparency and documentation obligations
- Ensure the provider supplies adequate Instructions for Use

**STEP 5 — Compliance Obligation Mapping** `[15 min]`

Based on the classification from Steps 1-4, map all applicable obligations:

| **Standard Contractual Clauses** | Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914 (controller-to-processor module) |

### Process

**STEP 1 — Role Determination** `[5 min]`

1.1. Determine data protection roles:

| Question | If YES → |
|---|---|
| Does the startup determine the purposes and means of processing? | Startup = Controller |
| Does the vendor process data on behalf of / under instructions from the startup? | Vendor = Processor |
| Do both parties jointly determine purposes and means? | Joint Controllers (Art. 26) |
| Is the vendor independently deciding how to use the data? | Vendor = Independent Controller (different DPA structure) |

1.2. Map the AI-specific data flow:
```
User Data → Startup (Controller) → Vendor API (Processor) → LLM Provider (Sub-Processor) → [Tools/APIs] (Further Sub-Processors)
```

**STEP 2 — DPA Core Provisions Drafting** `[20 min]`

Draft each provision in sequence:

**2.1 Subject Matter and Duration**
- Define the processing activities, duration, nature, and purpose
- Specify that processing relates to AI system operation
- Reference the underlying MSA

**2.2 Types of Personal Data and Data Subject Categories**
- Enumerate all categories with specificity
- Flag any special category data (Art. 9 GDPR) — triggers enhanced protections

| **Input/Output confidentiality** | All Inputs and Outputs of the AI system are Confidential Information | Prevents vendor monetization of data/insights |
| **Model Drift monitoring** | Processor must monitor for Model Drift; notify within 72 hours of detection | Prevents degraded/unsafe performance |
| **Bias testing** | Processor must conduct and document bias testing for AI decisions affecting individuals | Discrimination prevention |
| **Human oversight** | AI decisions with legal or significant effects must allow for human review | GDPR Art. 22; CAIA requirements |
| **Automated decision-making disclosure** | Processor must support controller's obligation to inform data subjects of automated decision-making | GDPR Art. 13(2)(f), 14(2)(g), 22(3) |

**STEP 3 — International Transfer Mechanisms** `[10 min]`

3.1. Map all locations where personal data will be processed, including:
- Vendor's primary processing location
- LLM provider's processing location (often US-based)
- Any additional tool/API call destinations

3.2. For each transfer outside the adequate jurisdiction:
- Implement Standard Contractual Clauses (Module 2: Controller-to-Processor or Module 3: Processor-to-Processor)
- Conduct Transfer Impact Assessment
- Identify supplementary measures if needed

3.3. For DIFC-specific operations: ensure compliance with DIFC Data Protection Law transfer provisions.

**STEP 4 — Breach Notification Procedures** `[10 min]`

Draft breach notification provisions with AI-specific event types:

| Event Type | Notification Deadline | To Whom |
|---|---|---|
| Standard personal data breach | Without undue delay, max 72 hours (to controller) | Controller → Supervisory Authority within 72 hours; data subjects if high risk |
| AI-specific: adversarial attack compromising data | 24 hours to controller | Controller assesses regulatory notification obligations |
| AI-specific: data poisoning affecting outputs | 24 hours to controller | Controller assesses impact on data subjects |
| AI-specific: prompt injection leading to data exfiltration | 24 hours to controller | Controller → immediate assessment and notification |
| AI-specific: model memorization / data leakage in outputs | 24 hours to controller | Controller → assess scope and notify |
| AI-specific: cross-tenant data exposure | 24 hours to controller | Controller → assess and notify all affected subjects |

**STEP 5 — DPIA Trigger Assessment** `[5 min]`

5.1. Assess whether a DPIA is required under GDPR Art. 35. A DPIA is **mandatory** if the AI processing involves:
- Systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects (profiling) with legal/significant effects
- Large-scale processing of special categories of data
- Systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas
- Any two or more from: evaluation/scoring, automated decision-making with legal effect, systematic monitoring, sensitive data, large scale, data matching/combining, vulnerable data subjects, innovative use of technology, transfer outside EU

5.2. If DPIA is required, include DPIA cooperation obligations in the DPA.

**Risk Score** = (Impact × Probability × Ease) / 3

| Score Range | Risk Level | Action Required |
|---|---|---|
| 1-5 | `LOW` | Accept or monitor |
| 6-15 | `MEDIUM` | Mitigate within 90 days |
| 16-30 | `HIGH` | Mitigate within 30 days |
| 31+ | `CRITICAL` | Mitigate before deployment / immediately |

| Open-source components used | Dependency list with licenses | Engineering |
| Customer contracts regarding AI IP | Agreements | Legal / sales |

### Legal Framework

| Law / Principle | Application |
|---|---|
| **Copyright Act (US 17 USC)** | Copyright ownership; work-for-hire; fair use |
| **Patent Act (US 35 USC)** | Inventorship requirements (human inventor) |
| **DTSA (18 USC §1836)** | Trade secret protection |
| **EU Copyright Directive** | Text and data mining exceptions (Art. 3-4) |
| **EU AI Act Art. 53(1)(c)** | GPAI provider copyright compliance |
| **Berne Convention** | International copyright protection |
| **Open source licenses** | GPL, MIT, Apache, etc. — compliance requirements |

### Process

**STEP 1 — IP Asset Inventory** `[15 min]`

Catalog all AI-related IP assets:

| Asset Category | Items to Inventory | Ownership Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Proprietary models** | Custom-trained models, fine-tuned models, adapter layers | Document: who built it, with what data, under what agreement |
| **Training datasets** | Curated datasets, labeled data, synthetic data | Document: source, license, any restrictions |
| **Algorithms & architectures** | Novel architectures, prompt engineering techniques, agent workflows | Document: human inventors, development records |
| **Software & code** | Application code, infrastructure code, tooling | Document: authorship, open-source dependencies |
| **AI-generated outputs** | Content, code, designs, analyses produced by AI | Document: what AI was used, what human contribution was made |
| **Trade secrets** | Proprietary methods, datasets, business logic | Document: protective measures in place |
| **Vendor-provided models** | Third-party models used under license | Document: license terms, usage restrictions, IP provisions |

**STEP 2 — Rights Chain Analysis** `[20 min]`

For each IP asset, trace the chain of rights:

2.1. **Who created it?**
- Employee → work-for-hire (check employment agreement includes IP assignment)
- Contractor → NOT work-for-hire by default (check contractor agreement for IP assignment)
- AI tool → copyright ownership uncertain; document human contribution
- Third-party vendor → check license/contract terms

2.2. **What rights do you have?**
- Full ownership (assignment)
- License (exclusive or non-exclusive; scope and restrictions)
- Fair use claim (document analysis)
- No rights (gap to address)

2.3. **What restrictions apply?**
- Open-source license obligations (copyleft: GPL → derivative works must be open; permissive: MIT/Apache → attribution required)
- Vendor license restrictions (model use limitations, output ownership provisions, training data restrictions)
- Customer contract obligations (who owns outputs generated for customers)

**STEP 3 — Training Data Audit** `[15 min]`

This is the highest-liability area. For each training data source:

| Data Source | License Type | Permits ML Training? | Permits Commercial Use? | Opt-Out Mechanism? | Risk Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Source] | [License] | Y/N/Unclear | Y/N | Y/N | LOW/MED/HIGH |

**Red flags:**
- Data scraped from websites without TOS review → `HIGH`
- Copyrighted works without license for ML training → `HIGH`
- Personal data used for training without consent/legal basis → `CRITICAL`
- No documentation of data provenance → `HIGH`
- Data sourced from jurisdictions with strict text-and-data-mining rules (EU without Art. 4 exception) → `MEDIUM`

**STEP 4 — Output IP Assessment** `[10 min]`

4.1. Assess copyrightability of AI-generated outputs under current law:
- US: Copyright requires human authorship; purely AI-generated works may not be copyrightable (Thaler v. Perlmutter; Copyright Office guidance)
- EU: Similar human authorship requirement under most member state laws
- Strategy: Document and maximize human creative contribution to strengthen copyright claims

4.2. Assess contractual IP position:
- Do vendor agreements confirm customer ownership of outputs? (Should be YES)
- Do customer agreements address IP ownership of outputs generated for them? (Must be clear)
- Does the LLM provider claim any rights to outputs? (Should be NO)

**STEP 5 — Gap Remediation Plan** `[10 min]`

For each identified gap:

| Gap | Risk | Remediation | Priority | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Missing contractor IP assignment | HIGH | Execute IP assignment agreements | Immediate | Legal/HR |
| Unlicensed training data | HIGH | License or remove; document fair use analysis | Immediate | Legal/Eng |
| Vendor contract silent on output IP | MEDIUM | Negotiate AI addendum | Next renewal | Legal |
| No trade secret protection program | MEDIUM | Implement NDA, access controls, documentation | 30 days | Legal/Security |
| Open-source compliance gaps | MEDIUM | Audit and remediate license compliance | 60 days | Engineering |

### Output

| Deliverable | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **IP Audit Report** | Structured document | Complete inventory of AI IP assets with ownership analysis |

## Workflow 10: AI Regulatory Change Impact Analysis

### Trigger

A new AI law, regulation, amendment, guidance document, enforcement action, or court decision is identified that may affect the startup's AI products, services, or operations.

### Input

| Required Input | Format | Source |
|---|---|---|
| The regulatory change (full text or summary) | Document / link | Legal / compliance / Kevin monitoring |
| Current compliance posture | SKILL.md outputs | Legal |
| Affected products and services | List | Product / engineering |
| Affected jurisdictions | List | Business / legal |
| Current contracts and obligations | Relevant agreements | Legal |
| Implementation timeline of the change | Dates | Legal analysis |

### Legal Framework

The framework for this workflow IS the regulatory change being analyzed, assessed against the startup's existing obligations under all laws tracked in SKILL.md Section 3.

### Process

**STEP 1 — Change Identification & Summary** `[10 min]`

1.1. Identify the source and authority:

| Source Type | Weight | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Enacted legislation** | Binding | EU AI Act amendments, CAIA, new state laws |
| **Final regulation / rule** | Binding | Implementing regulations, FTC rules |
| **Proposed legislation / rule** | Monitor | Bills in progress, proposed regulations |
| **Regulatory guidance** | Influential | EDPB guidelines, ICO guidance, FTC blog posts |
| **Enforcement action** | Precedential | FTC consent orders, GDPR fines, state AG actions |
| **Court decision** | Precedential | Federal/state court rulings on AI liability, IP, privacy |
| **Industry standard update** | Best practice | NIST AI RMF updates, ISO/IEC 42001 revisions |

1.2. Summarize the change in plain language: what changed, who it affects, when it takes effect, and what the penalties are for non-compliance.

**STEP 2 — Applicability Assessment** `[10 min]`

For each of the startup's AI products/services, determine:

| Question | Analysis |
|---|---|
| Does this change apply to our jurisdiction(s)? | [Assessment based on where the startup operates and where its users are] |
| Does this change apply to our AI system type? | [Assessment based on risk classification, use case, model type] |
| Does this change apply to our role? | [Assessment based on whether startup is provider, deployer, distributor, importer] |
| Are there exemptions that apply to us? | [Assessment: startup size, sandbox participation, transitional provisions] |
| What is the effective date? | [Date with compliance runway calculation] |

**STEP 3 — Gap Analysis Against Current Posture** `[15 min]`

Compare new requirements against current compliance status:

| New Requirement | Current Status | Gap? | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Requirement 1] | [What we currently do] | Y/N | LOW/MED/HIGH/CRIT |
| [Requirement 2] | [What we currently do] | Y/N | LOW/MED/HIGH/CRIT |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**STEP 4 — Impact Assessment** `[15 min]`

For each identified gap, assess:

| Impact Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Product** | Does this require product changes (features, disclosures, controls)? |
| **Engineering** | Does this require technical implementation (new controls, monitoring, documentation)? |
| **Legal/Contracts** | Do contracts need to be updated (AI addendum, DPA, ToS, privacy notice)? |
| **Operations** | Do internal processes need to change (policies, training, governance)? |
| **Financial** | What is the cost of compliance? What is the cost of non-compliance (fines, lost deals)? |
| **Timeline** | Can we comply by the effective date? If not, what interim measures are available? |

**STEP 5 — Remediation Roadmap** `[10 min]`

5.1. Prioritize changes by: (a) legal deadline, (b) severity of non-compliance, (c) customer impact, (d) implementation effort.

5.2. Create phased implementation plan:

| Phase | Timeline | Actions |
|---|---|---|
| **Immediate** (0-30 days) | Before effective date or ASAP | Critical compliance gaps; contract updates for new deals |
| **Short-term** (30-90 days) | Within first quarter | Product changes; policy updates; training |
| **Medium-term** (90-180 days) | Within two quarters | Full technical implementation; retroactive contract updates |
| **Long-term** (180+ days) | Ongoing | Monitoring; optimization; audit preparation |

5.3. Assign ownership for each action item.

**STEP 6 — Stakeholder Communication** `[5 min]`

6.1. Draft internal briefing for leadership: what changed, what it means for us, what we need to do, what it costs, what the risk of non-action is.

6.2. If the change affects customers: draft customer communication explaining any changes to services, terms, or practices.

6.3. Update Kevin's regulatory tracking in SKILL.md Appendix A.
